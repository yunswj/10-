The resistance of normal inhalation is divided into two parts, elastic
resistance accounts for \(70%
\) and \(30%
\) is inelastic resistance. The airway resistance concerned in the
question is inelastic resistance, accounting for \(80%
\). According to the different causes of resistance, it is divided into
the following two types. The contribution is given in square brackets:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Tissue resistance \(10%
  \)
\item
  Airway resistance \(90%
  \)
\end{enumerate}

Gas molecules and the resistance between gas molecules and the tube wall
account for \(80\% Â·\sim 90\%%
\). For the simplicity of problem research, and organizational
resistance contributes little to the final resistance. Therefore, only
the airway resistance is considered in the inelastic resistance section,
and the tissue resistance is not considered. Although the linear model
is easy to solve, it cannot describe the behavioral characteristics of
the complex respiratory system. The form of air flow in the respiratory
tract is very complicated and cannot be analyzed and calculated with the
simplest laminar flow.

According to the anatomical structure of the trachea, the entire airway
is divided into three levels-the large airway with cartilage support,
the trapped airway without cartilage support, and the small airway.

resistance is:

Part of the airway does not contain cartilage. When the transmural
pressure on the outside is close to 0, the cross-sectional area is
reduced, which is prone to airway trapping. This part of the airway with
elasticity is called trapped airway. The internal resistance is composed
of airflow resistance and elastic resistance, and the expression of the
two functions is related to the air content in the lungs. Their diameter
expands and contracts with the change of transmural pressure, but the
length change is not obvious. Therefore, these air passages are assumed
to be a fixed-length elastic cylindrical pipe whose volume \((V _c)\)
changes with its trans-wall pressure \((P _c)\). Airway elasticity is:

\[P _c=b-{\frac{1}{a}}ln(\frac{V _cmax}{V _c}-0.999)\]

where a and b are constants. According to the \(P _c-V _c\) curve
fitting of the airway, we get \(a = 0.35cm H _2O ^{-1}\),
\(b=2cm H _2O\). The air resistance of trapped airway \((R _c)\) is as
follows:

\[R _c = K _3(\frac{V _cmax}{V _c}) ^2\]

where \(K _3\) is a constant representing \(V When _c\) reaches the
maximum value \(V _cmax\), the air resistance of the trapped airway is
trapped. \(K _3\) \(V _cmax\) \(0.21 _{cm}~H_2O*S/L,0.15L\)

The 16 to 23 segments of the bronchus in the lungs are all called small
airways with a small cross-sectional area, so the internal airflow is
almost as laminar. The air resistance of the small airway (R \_s)
changes exponentially with the volume of air in the lung (V \_A):

\[R _s=B _s + A _s \times \exp(\frac{K _s(V _A-RV)}{VC })\]

. Among them, \(K _s, B _s, A _s, VC, RV\) are all constants, \(VC\)
represents vital capacity, and \(RV\) represents residual air volume in
the lungs. According to the change curve of \(R _s\) with \(V _A\) given
in the literature,
\(A _s = 10 cm H _2 o*S /L, B _s = 0.2cm~ H _2*S/L,K _s = -10\)
According to the physiological data of healthy men, \(VC\) and \(RV\)
take the value of \(3.95 L\) and \(1.24 L\).

Use Fluent to calculate the gas flow field calculations in the following
situations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The flow field in the tracheal tree that is directly connected to the
  bifurcated four to four levels and is completely transitioned.
\item
  The unsteady calculation of the flow field in the tracheal tree with
  the transition of the complete tube end smoothly and bifurcated to

\item
  The unsteady calculation of the flow field in the tracheal tree that
  is smoothly bifurcated to the fourth stage, and compares the effect of
  the bifurcation series on the gas flow in the previous stages.
\end{enumerate}

In order to facilitate the establishment of the model, here we can
choose the plane view of several parts of the airway cross-section. As
shown, \(F1\) represents the cross-section when the coordinates of \(Z\)
are \(0\). \(F2\) is the corresponding section when the coordinate of
\(X\) is \(0\), corresponding to the section on the front and back walls
of the trachea. Now we have inserted the left bronchus with four
cross-sections \(L1, L2, L3, L4\), and the right main bronchus with
three cross-sections \(R1, R2, R3\).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

In order to simplify the model and facilitate the actual operation, here
we adopted the direct connection model establishment method of
cylindrical pipes for the pipe connection at the bifurcation. We modeled
from the entrance of the main trachea to the fourth-level lung bronchus,
using a tetrahedral mesh to automatically divide it.\\
Under normal circumstances, since the human body's ventilation volume
per minute is at least \(3 L/min\) (deep anesthesia), it can exceed
\(100 L/min\) (during exercise), and more than \(200 L/min\) (measured
maximum) in a short period of time. Breath volume). Based on the current
medical research and the rationality of the experiment, we select the
diameter of the main bronchus at the entrance of healthy lungs of adults
is \(1.8 cm\), and the average import speed is \(50\sim1666 cm/s\). In
the resting state, the breath is \(12\sim18\) times per minute, and the
import speed is \(150cm/s\). In order to obtain the results that can
converge quickly, we use the \(Spalart-Allmaras\) turbulence model to
solve the problem, and iterate a total of \(58\) steps.

Through the analysis of the air velocity distribution in the lungs, it
can be known that because the angle between the right bronchus and the
main bronchus is smaller, the air flow in the right lung is greater than
that in the left lung. Based on the average inlet velocity of
\(150 cm/s\), the maximum velocity in the main flow field has reached
\(180 cm/s\), and the Reynolds number calculated from the maximum
velocity of the main flow field is \(2200\), which is very close. The
critical value for turbulent flow is \(2300\). The local velocity in the
trachea of the right bronchus reached a maximum of \(220 cm/s\).

Through researching relevant data, it is found that when the connection
is directly connected by a cylindrical tube, due to the large angle
between the left bronchus and the main trachea, the gas is shunted after
passing through the main trachea during inhalation, and there is a
longer section of the trachea after the shunt. The phenomenon of air
flow separation occurred in the obvious stagnation zone. This situation
is not conducive to the flow and transmission of gas in the human
trachea. However, in the transitional connection model of the curved
pipe, a pair of vortices with opposite rotation directions appear in the
secondary flow. In the model of the straight pipe connection, the
velocity distribution on the secondary flow is not so obvious.

The unsteady calculation of the three-stage bifurcated pipe model of the
elbow transition \\
is to study the gas flow state in the bronchus during a breathing cycle.
\\
Boundary conditions\\
We use a tetrahedral grid with a unit height of \(0.15cm\). A normal
person breathes \(12~18\) times per minute in a calm state, and an
average of \(15\) times is used in the calculation, so a cycle is
determined to be \(4.0s\), and the human breathing frequency is
\(0.25Hz\) at this time. The maximum speed of the import is
\(150 cm/s\). According to the existing physiological research data, the
relationship of import speed with time is

\[v=150 \times \sin(2 \times \pi \times t/T)\]

where \(T=4 s\). Other boundary conditions are the same as before.

When the maximum inhalation flow occurs in one second, the study of the
F1 cross-section shows that in the abnormal situation, because the
pipeline suddenly becomes smaller, high-speed fluid areas appear on both
sides of the branch pipe. When the speed of the intake pipe is the same,
the flow velocity in the normal bronchial main pipe is slightly larger
than the gas flow velocity in the bronchus causing the disease. At a
position far away from the lesion, the velocity profile of the two is
similar, but at the location of the lesion. Attachment, the flow pattern
has changed a lot. It is concluded that the narrowing of the bronchial
tubes on both sides caused by the lesions increases the velocity in this
part. The location of the lesion is on the inner side of the trachea.
After branching from the main pipe, the speed of the secondary flow
deviates to the outer side of the tube wall, so that the shearing force
on the outer side wall of the bronchus is greater than the inner side of
the tube wall. After a period of development in the sub-pipe. The flow
situation far away from the damage is the same as before.
